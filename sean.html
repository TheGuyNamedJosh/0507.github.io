  <h2>Sean James: 22182627</h2><br><br>
<p>Within AI and Robotics, many questions arise, both ethical and moral, I believe that if Robots were to be implemented into our military, it could greatly benefit our society. 
  It has many strengths, such as decreasing the workload on humans as well as decreasing the negative effects of war, through a major decrease in loss of life but also in other fields like effective training methods using robot soldiers, or even in other areas such as combat medics or disaster relief. 
  With all these positives its hard not to agree with the implementation of robots into the military, however with these positives comes drawbacks, especially in todays current standpoint and development of combat robots.</p>

<p>With the introduction of early robots in todays society, we have seen many issues arise in particular areas such as friendly fire, or product malfunctions. 
  These factors raise questions to whether or not we are ready for robot soldiers, as they have not been tested extensively enough to conclude their proper uses on the field. 
  I do believe though that companies like Boston Dynamics or Milrem Robotics are paving the way for the future of War robots, and with companies such as these helping to further the safety of Robots, I believe that there is a chance that we will be seeing them in the not so near future. </p>

  <p>Over the years we have seen questions being raised in regard to how Robot Soldiers should be implemented into our armies, they are more effective than your average soldier, they cost less, they don’t have any self-preservation, so why shouldn’t we implement them sooner. 
  Ethics, we as people believe that if something has no regard to human life or doesn’t believe in self-preservation, it shouldn’t be fighting our wars as we don’t know whether or not it will distinguish between friend or foe, civilian or combatant. 
  But also with their introduction I think we would see war start to speed up as with efficiency comes speed, and what that means for war is detrimental to society as with speed comes collateral damage. 
  Because Robots have no care for life and are able to follow orders, it raises questions what would stop someone from using them the wrong way, to oppress people or take over nations, rule over as a dictatorship with an army that would do anything when commanded. 
  These questions are what raise ethical problems which must be solved through testing and perfecting of the robot soldier.</p>

<p>I do believe robots today are not ready to be released into combat and although we are seeing them being placed in countries like Ukraine and Russia, we have yet to test their effectiveness in their early state. 
  However, with increased areas of effectiveness and productivity it is sure to bring many quality assurances to the military but the consequences of Robot Soldiers may be just as equal as its positives and so must be treated as such, increased productivity means an ease of access to an ever growing army which may lead to more frequent wars and conflicts around the world. 
  On top of this they are susceptible to hacking, which may cause major issues if we become dependent on Robots for fighting.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I still believe that Robots are the key to the future of warfare, but whether that future is close by is unknown. 
  I do think that with enough testing, robot soldiers will become a great success with little drawbacks if we take action against reduced autonomy, increased security as well as safety precautions to ensure loss of life doesn’t remain an issue.</p>
