  <h1>Choices: AI and Robots Shaping the Future</h1>
  <p style="text-align: center;">AI and robots have been prevalent in various forms of media, such as movies like Terminator, Ex Machina, and Chappie. What these movies have in common is the portrayal of AI with combat capabilities. In both Ex Machina and Terminator, we witness the destructive power of conscious robot soldiers, while in Chappie, we see the risks associated with mass-produced single autonomous robots and their vulnerability to hacking. To avoid these potential dangers, extensive testing is crucial to address hacking concerns, along with implementing fail-safe measures to prevent control of robot soldiers by unauthorized individuals.</p>
  <p style="text-align: center;">One important step we should take to mitigate problems is to limit the autonomy granted to robots. While we acknowledge that robot soldiers are essential for the advancement of human civilization, their introduction raises ethical questions due to their lack of emotion and humanity, which could prove detrimental in the field. However, despite their current unreliability, the numerous benefits brought by robot soldiers make it hard to resist their implementation in the military.</p>
  <p style="text-align: center;">Nevertheless, ethical concerns must be addressed, and precautions taken to ensure their effectiveness and minimize risks. One significant issue observed is friendly fire, which highlights the need for further development and testing. Some AI and robots have been at the center of controversy, as instances of injuring their own team have been reported. For instance, in 2007, a robot malfunctioned and "started firing on its own," resulting in the death of nine soldiers and injuring 14 others. This incident demonstrates the potential advantages and dangers associated with the introduction of robots.</p>
  <p style="text-align: center;">In conclusion, our group believes in the potential of robot soldiers to positively impact the world. However, as we embark on this new era of engineering, caution must be exercised to ensure robots are well-designed, resistant to hacking, and guided by ethical principles to reduce unnecessary casualties. Additionally, robot soldiers can be utilized in other aspects of the military, providing aid in relief efforts or assisting with tasks that may pose challenges for human soldiers. We firmly believe that robot soldiers represent the future, and as time progresses, they will become increasingly advanced and effective.</p>
