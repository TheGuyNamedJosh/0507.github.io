  <h2>Joshua Hodgson: 22176648</h2>
<p>I think the advancements in military robotics and artificial intelligence will bring about significant changes to war. 
    Personally, I believe that these technologies have the potential to offer various benefits, including improved efficiency, reduced casualties, and increased precision. 
    However, I also have concerns about the ethical and moral implications they raise, such as the preservation of human life and the adherence to international laws.</p>
<br>
<p>In my opinion, military robotics and AI need to conform to the established worldwide laws that oversee warfare. 
    These laws encompass fundamental principles such as proportionality, distinction, and precautions aimed at minimizing harm to civilians. 
    However, it is essential to address the challenge of ensuring that these systems can effectively evaluate and apply these principles within intricate, real-time battle scenarios. 
    The potential for inadvertent violations and the absence of accountability for actions executed by machines are significant concerns that require attention and resolution. 
    Military decision-making must consider context, empathy, and moral reasoning. 
    However, relying too much on autonomous systems can undermine these human qualities, leading to decisions that overlook the intricacies of conflict situations.
     It is crucial that they prioritize safeguarding human judgment and values in military operations to ensure ethical decision-making remains at the core of war.</p>
<br>
<p>The deployment of military robotics and AI raises significant challenges regarding accountability and responsibility for actions taken by autonomous systems. 
    Traditional legal frameworks are ill-equipped to handle issues related to accountability when AI systems make decisions independently. 
    Determining liability for any harm caused, whether to civilians or military personnel, becomes a complex task. 
    Efforts are needed to establish legal mechanisms and guidelines for holding individuals or entities accountable for the actions of AI systems. 
    Military robotics and AI could reduce collateral damage and protect civilian populations in conflict zones. 
    However, there are concerns about the unintended consequences and potential for misuse. 
    Malfunctions, hacking, or misinterpretation of data by autonomous systems could lead to unintended harm, violating the principle of proportionality. 
    Safeguards and comprehensive risk assessments must be in place to minimize the potential for harm to non-combatants.</p>
<br>
<p>The advancements in military robotics and AI could also lead to an arms race, with nations competing to develop increasingly sophisticated and autonomous weapons systems. 
    We could even be seeing this in the near future with China’s ‘Robotic Yak’. 
    This raises concerns about the potential for misuse and the destabilization of global security. 
    International cooperation, dialogue, and international treaties are necessary to mitigate the risks associated with the proliferation of military robotics and AI. </p>
<br>
<p>In conclusion, I believe military robotics and AI have the potential to change warfare, but they also present ethical and moral challenges. 
    Successfully addressing these concerns would require various approaches, involving policymakers, ethicists, military officials, and the public. 
    It would be crucial to establish international norms, laws, and accountability systems that can ensure the responsible and ethical development, deployment, and use of military robotics and AI while also preserving human rights, reducing harm, and upholding fundamental moral principles.</p>
