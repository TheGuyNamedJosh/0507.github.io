  <h1>Technology and Topic: Advancements in Military Robotics and AI: Enhancing Warfare Through Technology</h1>

  <p style="text-align: center;">Military Robots are autonomous or remote-controlled devices designed for use in the military. The history of Robot Soldiers and Military AI stems back as far as WW2 with the use of German Goliath remote-controlled demolition vehicles, other more advanced AI at the time was the Teletank which was used to reduce human casualties during the war. However, both of these early ‘Robot Soldiers’ were very ineffective, as the Teletank couldn’t be used accurately due to their lack of cameras and the Goliath mine which could be make useless if the control cable was cut. These early setbacks were the building block for the new more advanced AI we are seeing in today’s military. With innovations being made at Boston Dynamics to the new AI MIS UGV’s which are being seen all around the world, AI has taken massive steps progress wise since its beginnings.</p>
  <p style="text-align: center;">Robots in Production Today</p>
  <ul>
    <li>THeMIS (Tracked Hybrid Modular Infantry System), designed for military application to provide support for dismounted troops by serving as troop platforms and remote weapons stations.</li>
    <li>Russian Marker Combat Robots, designed to be used in the field as support for ground personnel, built with anti-tank capabilities as well as UAV.</li>
    <li>China's 'Robotic Yak', the largest electric powered quadruped robot which is used to carry supplies and munitions of up to 160kg and can run at up to 10 kilometers per hour.</li>
    <li>Atlas, the most advanced and mobile robot in development, made to be the most dynamic and humanoid robot with advanced control systems to demonstrate human level agility.</li>
  </ul>
  <p style="text-align: center;">“There is widespread interest around the world in developing artificial intelligence for military purposes” This newfound interest in AI has lead to fast developments in Military Robots. They have advanced the way we will use Nuclear Weapons delivery systems as it can “improve and develop nuclear-capable aerial and naval forces.” Boston Dynamics is one of the leading AI engineering companies that specializes in the production of Military AI and has helped in areas such as equipment testing which is a vital part of training and helping reduce the time taken to normally test products such as ballistic vests, armored vehicles.</p>
  <p style="text-align: center;">Military Robots are being created with the goal of advanced mobility and intelligence. Creating robots for the purpose of transportation, rescue missions and other high-risk jobs, which could help limit the number of casualties seen on the battlefield. Other ways AI and military robots are being used is through training, as they can be used to simulate real-life scenarios. These factors are the reason why AI in the military is so vital and should be discussed further.</p>
